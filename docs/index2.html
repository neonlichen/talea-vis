            Chronological direction: clockwise<br>

Bright yellow background color: represents a loud texture and the single fundamental C and its partials, which is the harmonic foundation for part 1. 
Five colored strands: representing the five voices of the polyphonic structure. blue=voice 1, red=voice 2 [etc]<br>

“Range filter”. The development of the melodic ranges of each voice are depicted in the movement of the lines, with pitch height ascending from the center towards the periphery.<br>
